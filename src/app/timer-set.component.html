  <h2>Question on component communication: </h2>
  <p>
      In this simple chess-clock exercise, I needed for a set of components ("timers") to behave like radio buttons - when one player's timer is started, the others are automatically stopped, as a convenience.
  </p>
  <p>
      For now, I've implemented this by exposing each timer's on/off state as an input, so that the parent can manipulate each one directly.  
  </p>
  <p>
      Thoughts?
  </p>
  <p>
      I would prefer to just signal the stop request toÂ all relevant children and let them encapsulate their own state, but none of the component communication patterns in <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html#!#parent-to-child-on-changes">the cookbook</a> seems to match.
